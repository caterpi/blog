## Title
Because of the placement of her name and the title, the cover reads “Becoming Michelle Obama”. Indeed, a huge part of her autobiography is about the transformation of Michelle Robinson into Michelle Obama. What’s interesting is that she talks about Michelle Obama as a snapshot of Michelle Robinson’s life, who she was at a particular point in time rather than the end result. The book is titled in the present participle form of “to become” for a reason. Becom-ing conveys a sense of continuous evolution. It aligns with her message that we are continuously becoming some version of ourselves. Even though we know her as Michelle Obama, she emphasizes that she is still becoming. 

## Reflection
Since I’ve read Becoming, I’ve unpacked a lot of emotions in my personal journal. Here are some downstream thoughts that are loosely tied to her main message. I’m trying to keep them not too mushy gushy.

#### 1. Yesterday, today and tomorrow are just snapshots of who I am becoming.
By internalizing this and seeing that my past is only a snapshot of my life, I was able to make progress on how I feel about my past. I can pinpoint to certain moments, sometimes, years of my life that I see as “inferior” versions of myself and I tend to disassociate from that. “No, that was me in the past, but not who I am now”. And I do give myself credit for taking the actions to grow as a person, but I never bothered to really understand how I felt about those versions. Recently, I’ve found it incredibly therapeutic to approach my past with more empathy. For example, I teared up just imagining giving a hug to my past self that didn’t have many friends and felt lonely. When I started to forgive myself more and more, it felt so refreshing. Now, a huge part of loving myself also means being kind to the parts of myself that I didn’t or couldn’t love before. 

Perhaps this sounds orthogonal to what Michelle is saying. After all, she is telling us to propel forward, not to dwell in the past. I think they’re two sides of the same coin. The key to being happy with who you are becoming requires love for who you were before.

#### 2. I’m always a “work in progress”. 
“What am I doing for my next version?” Personally, right now, it’s graciously hosting my sister for the time being. This is one of those things where I wish I were ten times better than how I’m actually handling the situation. I don’t want to abandon my sister to go through COVID-19 times alone, yet the work I need to put in to make this a successful symbiotic relationship is honestly... daunting. It’s complicated because it’s not just about meshing our lives together, but also working on our relationship. I’m going to try my best and like I’ve said in this piece, not beat myself up when I feel like I’ve failed as a sister.

## What About You?
For those of you who have read it, what did you take away from Michelle’s words? And for all of you, what better self are you working towards?
