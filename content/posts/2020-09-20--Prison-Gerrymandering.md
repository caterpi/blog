With many woke friends, I ‘ve been seeing more sensational infographics on political issues on Instagram. “Prison Gerrymandering” is a topic I came across a while ago that I thought deserved more attention outside of the square post.

## Criminal Justice System
During quarantine, I’ve seen some great Netflix documentaries on our broken criminal justice system. I highly recommend watching the 13th by Ava DuVernay which narrates the history and policy around the criminal justice system and the evolution from slavery to mass incarceration. If you don’t know it by now, here are well-established truths.

#### 1. Systemic racism exists. 
Blacks and latinx people are disproportionately incarcerated.
#### 2. Mass incarceration is modern day form of slavery.
Under the guise of fighting war on drugs and crime, mass incarceration has been wielded as a political weapon to systematically oppress the black communities. https://www.sentencingproject.org/criminal-justice-facts/

## Census
There exists an outdated federal policy that counts the incarcerated are counted as residents of the location of imprisonment. This allows local and state governments to exercise political advantage by conveniently counting the imprisoned as “residents” and drawing up voting districts around prisons. Effectively, the disenfranchised inmates are disproportionately bolstering the political power of the rest of the voters in those districts. So, the inmates are being discounted from their home communities where their votes would be counted if they were to vote, and instead, strengthening the communities they don’t represent. Often, it’s the rural white towns that benefit from filling their voting population with POC inmates. “In New York, for example, approximately 77% of all prisoners are African-American or Latino, but 98% of all prisons are located in disproportionately white State Senate districts” (naacp).

## 2020 Election
This could make a difference in swing states such as Wisconsin and Iowa which were cited from the articles I’ve read as places where this issue is most relevant. Two out of three voting districts in Waucan, Wisconsin, consist of mostly prisoners who can not vote. Even though a bill was presented in September to redistrict inmates in Wisconsin, it doesn’t look like this was passed for the 2020 Census. Only nine states so far have implemented policies to count inmates as residents of their home communities. It’s a step forward, but seeing how most are historically blue states (New York, California, etc.), it doesn't seem promising.

As an aside, When They See us, is another great Eva Duvernay film to watch. It's a drama film recounting the Central Park jogger case from the victims' perspective.
