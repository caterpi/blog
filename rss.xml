More of my woke friends are putting a lot of effort to regularly share posts containing infographics and statistics relevant to political issues. Some of them are very useful and I very much welcome them (ex. voting registration reminders). Since only those who seek out the information will come across these anyways, I’m somewhat impartial to people posting them. Of course, the embedded information is mostly surface-level and individuals should do due-diligence and do the homework. Anyway, “Prison Gerrymandering” is a topic I came across that I wanted to look into beyond the square post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During quarantine, I’ve seen some great Netflix documentaries on our broken criminal justice system. I highly recommend watching the 13th by Ava DuVernay which narrates the history and policy around the criminal justice system and the evolution from slavery to mass incarceration. If you don’t know it by now, here are well-established truths.&lt;/p&gt;

Systemic racism exists.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blacks and latinx people are disproportionately incarcerated.&lt;/p&gt;

Mass incarceration is modern day form of slavery.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the guise of fighting war on drugs and crime, mass incarceration has been wielded as a political weapon to systematically oppress the black communities. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sentencingproject.org/criminal-justice-facts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.sentencingproject.org/criminal-justice-facts/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There exists an outdated federal policy that counts the incarcerated are counted as residents of the location of imprisonment. This allows local and state governments to exercise political advantage by conveniently counting the imprisoned as “residents” and drawing up voting districts around prisons. Effectively, the disenfranchised inmates are disproportionately bolstering the political power of the rest of the voters in those districts. So, the inmates are being discounted from their home communities where their votes would be counted if they were to vote, and instead, strengthening the communities they don’t represent. Often, it’s the rural white towns that benefit from filling their voting population with POC inmates. “In New York, for example, approximately 77% of all prisoners are African-American or Latino, but 98% of all prisons are located in disproportionately white State Senate districts” (naacp).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could make a difference in swing states such as Wisconsin and Iowa which were cited from the articles I’ve read as places where this issue is most relevant. Two out of three voting districts in Waucan, Wisconsin, consist of mostly prisoners who can not vote. Even though a bill was presented in September to redistrict inmates in Wisconsin, it doesn’t look like this was passed for the 2020 Census. Only nine states so far have implemented policies to count inmates as residents of their home communities. It’s a step forward, but seeing how most are historically blue states (New York, California, etc.), it doesn’t seem promising.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;For me, becoming isn’t about arriving somewhere or achieving a certain aim. I see it instead as forward motion, a means of evolving, a way to reach continuously toward a better self. The journey doesn’t end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the placement of her name and the title, the cover reads “Becoming Michelle Obama”. Indeed, a huge part of her autobiography is about the transformation of Michelle Robinson into Michelle Obama. What’s interesting is that she talks about Michelle Obama as a snapshot of Michelle Robinson’s life, who she was at a particular point in time rather than the end result. The book is titled in the present participle form of “to become” for a reason. Becom-ing conveys a sense of continuous evolution. It aligns with her message that we are continuously becoming some version of ourselves. Even though we know her as Michelle Obama, she emphasizes that she is still becoming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I’ve read Becoming, I’ve unpacked a lot of emotions in my personal journal. Here are some downstream thoughts that are loosely tied to her main message. I’m trying to keep them not too mushy gushy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-yesterday-today-and-tomorrow-are-just-snapshots-of-who-i-am-becoming&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1-yesterday-today-and-tomorrow-are-just-snapshots-of-who-i-am-becoming&quot; aria-label=&quot;1 yesterday today and tomorrow are just snapshots of who i am becoming permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1. Yesterday, today and tomorrow are just snapshots of who I am becoming.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By internalizing this and seeing that my past is only a snapshot of my life, I was able to make progress on how I feel about my past. I can pinpoint to certain moments, sometimes, years of my life that I see as “inferior” versions of myself and I tend to disassociate from that. “No, that was me in the past, but not who I am now”. And I do give myself credit for taking the actions to grow as a person, but I never bothered to really understand how I felt about those versions. Recently, I’ve found it incredibly therapeutic to approach my past with more empathy. For example, I teared up just imagining giving a hug to my past self that didn’t have many friends and felt lonely. When I started to forgive myself more and more, it felt so refreshing. Now, a huge part of loving myself also means being kind to the parts of myself that I didn’t or couldn’t love before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this sounds orthogonal to what Michelle is saying. After all, she is telling us to propel forward, not to dwell in the past. I think they’re two sides of the same coin. The key to being happy with who you are becoming requires love for who you were before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What am I doing for my next version?” Personally, right now, it’s graciously hosting my sister for the time being. This is one of those things where I wish I were ten times better than how I’m actually handling the situation. I don’t want to abandon my sister to go through COVID-19 times alone, yet the work I need to put in to make this a successful symbiotic relationship is honestly… daunting. It’s complicated because it’s not just about meshing our lives together, but also working on our relationship. I’m going to try my best and like I’ve said in this piece, not beat myself up when I feel like I’ve failed as a sister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before watching Call to Courage, I thought of courage as big acts of bravery. I’m imagining someone who chooses an untraditional path in life following her dreams. Brown’s talk on courage lies far away from this imagery. Instead, she looks at courage with a more casual lense. It doesn’t always have to be a life-changing decision; we can all be courageous in different parts of our lives such as relationships or work. For example, saying “I love you” first in a relationship is also courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She defines courage as choosing to show up knowing you will fail. There is no courage without this fear, or more broadly, vulnerability. She uses findings from decades of research as well as personal anecdotes to illustrate the importance of vulnerability in order to be courageous, compassionate, and creative. This is one of my favorite talks I’ve ever listened to. She is funny, inspirational, and educational while keeping it so real. Anyone can relate to her stories at some level. I think I “aww”-ed, cried, and laughed all during this 1-hour talk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;measure-of-courage-vulnerability&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#measure-of-courage-vulnerability&quot; aria-label=&quot;measure of courage vulnerability permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Measure of Courage: Vulnerability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown’s 20 years of research finds vulnerability to be the best measure of courage. That is, “you can measure how brave you are by how vulnerable you are willing to be”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the icky emotions like shame, scarcity, fear, anxiety, uncertainty, grief are what make us feel exposed and uncomfortable. We don’t want others to see these emotions in us, but we must let them, because they give birth to love, belonging, and joy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown says, joy is the most vulnerable human emotion. We’re afraid to lean into joy, because we’re afraid that it could be taken away at any moment. I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve imagined something terrible happening to my sisters when we are having a good time and thinking that this could be the last memorable thing we do together. The fear is tangible, especially because we experience glimpses of this or hear stories of loss from others around us. I definitely think about these tragic “what if” situations more often ever since my sister has been really sick. In Brown’s words, I’m dress-rehearsing tragedy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her research shows that people who can truly lean into joy have one thing in common: gratitude. We know listing three things you’re grateful for everyday is proven to improve happiness. So why was I so surprised? First, I think it’s because I feel generally happy, but there’s only a handful of moments I’ve felt pure joy. Even when I did experience joy, the same memories no longer bring me joy later on for lots of other reasons. Over time, I’ve learned to demote the current value of joy in anticipation of how I would feel about it in the future with thoughts like “I don’t want to overvalue these moments with him or her too much, because what if they’re no longer part of my life?” This talk made me realize how I’ve been holding myself back and how much I actually want more joy in all of my relationships. I actively make microadjustments to my thoughts and behaviors to be happier, but I wasn’t doing the same to be more joyful. The goal isn’t to eliminate the fear of loneliness or loss, but to accept them in order to harvest the goods of all relationships. Now, even with the best friendships I have, I acknowledge they may disappear. At first, it was scary to embrace these thoughts, but it made me appreciate the lasting friendships even more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./../media/gooey_cookies.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;gooey_cookies&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brown calls shame, scarcity, fear, anxciety, uncertainty, grief, the gooey center of vulnerability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;loss&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#loss&quot; aria-label=&quot;loss permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Loss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From interviewing subjects who’ve experienced true trauma (mass shooting, child death, genocide, etc.) Brown shares three of her biggest insights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-expressing-gratitude-shows-we-understand-the-magnitude-of-others-loss&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1-expressing-gratitude-shows-we-understand-the-magnitude-of-others-loss&quot; aria-label=&quot;1 expressing gratitude shows we understand the magnitude of others loss permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1. Expressing gratitude shows we understand the magnitude of others’ loss.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We feel so guilty talking about what we have in front of others who don’t have it.  For example, I’ve always felt it was insensitive talking about my mom in front of a friend who’s lost hers. This is true even with the closest people in my life. For the longest time, I shied away from confronting my mom about her trauma.
It’s the inner fear of causing pain in someone or coming across insensitive. But Brown points out that when I avoid the subject of loss, I’m taking that opportunity away from the other person as well. However, the bigger realization I had was I needed to have more faith that people are stronger than I give them credit for. Just because it’s a hard subject doesn’t mean they’ll only feel pain or they’re going to break down. I was being weak-minded. I did get to ask my mom about her past recently and she was able to share lots of positive emotions from a subject of pain. In hindsight, I had lacked the emotional strength and faith in my mom. Also, in this particular case, giving space for pain did give space for positive emotions as well. &lt;/p&gt;

We miss the simple, ordinary moments while chasing extraordinary moments.&lt;/h4&gt;

Just do the joyful thing.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She quotes Stuart Brown who defines play as “time spent without purpose”. I felt personally attacked, because I have the tendency to feel guilty about the time that wasn’t productive. If it’s not work, I want it to go towards self-improvement. Maybe it’s because we millenials have the tendency to be hyper-active and hyper-productive. We’re surrounded by people who are overachievers in all aspects of life, including in the “fun” department. I value adventure and experience, but I’ve become too impatient.  It’s as if I need to do something new and extraordinary every other weekend. Even during quarantine, I see people who are hiking the Half Dome, visiting friends and going places (some are definitely questionable choices), making me feel like I’m not making the most of my time. I tell my friends I’m a boring person now, but the truth is, I’m okay not baking instagram-worthy bread, being alone with my books, and the most exciting things being underwhelmingly ordinary things like seeing a puppy on the street. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was intentional to write a piece on vulnerability as my first post. I am neither confident in my writing nor articulate on many topics I’d like to write about. However, in the spirit of being brave, I choose to pursue this small ambition of mine. I end with a quote that Brené starts with in her talk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— Theodore Roosevelt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
